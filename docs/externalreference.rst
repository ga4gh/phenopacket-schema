Explanations
############

id
~~
The syntax of the identifier is application specific. It is RECOMMENDED that this is a :ref:`rstcurie` that uniquely identifies
the evidence source, e.g. **ISBN:978-3-16-148410-0** or **PMID:123456**. However, it could be a URL/URI, or other
relevant identifier.

It is RECOMMENDED to use a :ref:`rstcurie` identifier. If one is used, it is RECOMMENDED that the corresponding
:ref:`rstresource` be provided in the :ref:`rstmetadata` element. For the above example, one would provide
an :ref:`rstresource` for PubMed (see the :ref:`rstmetadata` for this example).

reference
~~~~~~~~~
It is RECOMMENDED that a full or partial URL/URI is provided for systems to resolve an external reference, especially in
the absence of a CURIE identifier.

description
~~~~~~~~~~~
An optional free text description of the evidence. In the example above, the title of a published article is shown.
