This element contains structured definitions of the resources and ontologies used within the phenopacket. It is considered to be a required element of a valid Phenopacket and application Q/C software should check this.

The `MetaData` element MUST have one :ref:`rstresource` element for each ontology or terminology whose
terms are used in the Phenopacket. For instance, if a MONDO term is used to specify the disease and
HPO terms are used to specify the phenotypes of a patient, then the `MetaData` element MUST have
one `Resource` element each for MONDO and HPO.

Explanations
############

created
~~~~~~~
This element is a `ISO8601 UTC timestamp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_ for when this phenopacket was
created in ISO, e.g.,  "2018-03-01T00:00:00Z".


created_by
~~~~~~~~~~
This is a string that represents an identifier for the contributor/ program. The expected syntax and semantics are application-dependent.


submitted_by
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a string that represents an identifier for the person who submitted the phenopacket (who may not be
the person who created the phenopacket).


resources
~~~~~~~~~
This element contains a listing of the ontologies/resources referenced in the phenopacket.


updates
~~~~~~~
This element contains a list of :ref:`rstupdate` objects which contain information about when, what and who updated
a phenopacket. This is only necessary when a phenopacket is being used as a persistent record and is being continuously
updated. Resources should provide information about how this is being used.

phenopacket_schema_version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A string representing the version of the phenopacket-schema according to which a phenopacket was made. Permitted values
MUST be one of `1.0.0`, `1.0` or `2.0`. Versions `1.0.0` and `1.0` are equivalent and the `1.0` string should be
preferred. This version of the schema is `2.0`.

external_references
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A list of :ref:`rstexternalreference` (such as the PubMed id of a publication from which a
phenopacket was derived).
