File

The File message allows a Phenopacket to link the structured phenotypic data it contains to external files which can be
used to inform analyses. For example the file could link to sequencing data in `VCF format <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21653522>`_ as well
as other data types.

Given that ``File`` elements are listed in various locations such as the ``Phenopacket``, ``Biosample``, ``Family`` etc.
which can in turn be nested, individual files MUST be contained within their appropriate scope.
For example within a ``Phenopacket`` for germline samples of an individual or within the scope of the ``Phenopacket.Biosample``
in the case of genomic data derived from sequencing or other characterisation of that biosample. Aggregate data types
such as ``Cohort`` and ``Family`` MUST contain aggregate file data i.e. merged/multi-sample VCF at the level of the Family/Cohort, but each member
Phenopacket can contain its own locally-scope files pertaining to that individual/biosample(s).

**Example**

The message below shows how a compressed VCF file should be specified. It indicates the sample identifier `NA12345` in
the VCF file is equivalent to the Phenopacket individual identifier `patient23456`. The `fileAttributes` indicate that
the file was called against the GRCh38 genome assembly, indicates the `fileFormat` is VCF and also provides a human-readable
`description`.

uri
~~~
URI for the file e.g. `file://data/genomes/file1.vcf.gz` or `https://opensnp.org/data/60.23andme-exome-vcf.231?1341012444`.

individual_to_file_identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A map of identifiers mapping an individual referred to in the Phenopacket
to an identifier used in the file.
The key values must correspond to the Individual::id for the individuals in the message or Biosample::id for biosamples,
the values must map to identifiers in the file.

file_attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A map of attributes which a resource might want to share about the contents of a file. For example a file containing
genomic coordinates (e.g. VCF, BED) SHOULD contain an entry with the key `genomeAssembly` and a value indicating the
genome assembly the contents of the file was called against. We recommend using the
`Genome Reference Consortium <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc>`_ nomenclature e.g. `GRCh37`, `GRCh38`.
