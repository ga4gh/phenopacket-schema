Sex
###

An enumeration used to represent the sex of an individual.
This element does not represent gender identity or :ref:`rstkaryotypicsex`, but instead represents typical
"phenotypic sex", as would be determined by a midwife or physician at birth.

.. warning::
   In standard genetic pedigree files (like PLINK), sex is typically encoded as
   ``1`` for Male and ``2`` for Female. The Phenopackets internal schema assigns
   the integer ``1`` to ``FEMALE`` and ``2`` to ``MALE``. **Do not use integers to
   encode sex in Phenopackets.** This discrepancy will not affect your data because
   the Phenopackets JSON and YAML implementations require you to use the explicit
   string values (``"MALE"``, ``"FEMALE"``, ``"UNKNOWN_SEX"``). The underlying
   software will automatically handle the correct data serialization.

Implementation note - this is an enumerated type, therefore the values represented below are the only legal values. The
value of this type SHALL NOT be null, instead it SHALL use the 0 (zero) ordinal element as the default value, should none
be specified.
