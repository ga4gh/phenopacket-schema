.. _rstacmgPathogenicityClassification:

AcmgPathogenicityClassification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. csv-table:: Definition  of the ``AcmgPathogenicityClassification`` enumeration
   :header: Name, Ordinal, Description

    UNCERTAIN_SIGNIFICANCE, 0, There is not enough information at this time to support a more definitive classification of this variant
    PATHOGENIC, 1,  This variant directly contributes to the development of disease
    LIKELY_PATHOGENIC, 2, There is a high likelihood (greater than 90% certainty) that this variant is disease-causing
    LIKELY_BENIGN, 3, This variant is not expected to have a major effect on disease. However, the scientific evidence is currently insufficient to prove this conclusively
    BENIGN, 4, This variant does not cause disease


.. _rsttherapeuticactionability:

TherapeuticActionability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. csv-table:: Definition  of the ``TherapeuticActionability`` enumeration
   :header: Name, Ordinal, Description

    UNKNOWN_ACTIONABILITY, 0, There is not enough information at this time to support any therapeutic actionability for this variant
    NOT_ACTIONABLE, 1, This variant has no therapeutic actionability.
    ACTIONABLE, 2, This variant is known to be therapeutically actionable.

Example
#######

The following element shows how to denote an interpretation of a variant as pathogenic.

.. code-block:: yaml

    variantInterpretation:
      acmgPathogenicityClassification: "PATHOGENIC"
      variant:
        expressions:
        - syntax: "hgvs"
          value: "NM_001848.2:c.877G>A"
        allelicState:
          id: "GENO:0000135"
          label: "heterozygous"


Explanations
############

acmg_pathogenicity_classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ACMG has recommended a five-tier classification system (`Richards et al., 2015 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25741868/>`_).


- Pathogenic (PATHOGENIC): This variant directly contributes to the development of disease.
- Likely pathogenic (LIKELY_PATHOGENIC): There is a high likelihood (greater than 90% certainty) that this variant is disease-causing.
- Uncertain significance (UNCERTAIN_SIGNIFICANCE): There is not enough information at this time to support a more definitive classification of this variant.
- Likely benign (LIKELY_BENIGN): This variant is not expected to have a major effect on disease; however, the scientific evidence is currently insufficient to prove this conclusively.
- Benign (BENIGN): This variant does not cause disease.

therapeutic_actionability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An enumeration flagging the variant as being a candidate for treatment/ clinical intervention of the disorder caused by
this variant, which could improve the clinical outcome.

variant
~~~~~~~
The subject of the variant interpretation. See :ref:`rstvariant` for more information.
